# Decisions

Choices the spec left open, and what this codebase does about them.

## Architecture

1. **TypeScript, Express, Drizzle.** The spec asked for Python and FastAPI; this repo is the Replit
   submission and keeps the Replit monorepo layout (`artifacts/api-server`, `artifacts/rewind`,
   `lib/db`). The one-process rule is honoured where it matters: the API server hosts the routes, the
   SSE streams and the agent workers. On Replit the frontend is a separate static artifact routed on
   `/`; off Replit the API server serves the built frontend itself.
2. **Reserved VM, not Autoscale.** Autoscale is request-scoped and scales to zero, which would kill
   running branches. `.replit` pins `deploymentTarget = "vm"`.
3. **Access key instead of Clerk.** Viewing is public; writes need `X-Rewind-Key`. Clerk and its
   proxy middleware were removed. `sessions.user_id` stays in the schema, unused, so the migration is
   additive.
4. **Additive schema only.** `drizzle-kit push` prompts on drops and renames, and Replit's post-merge
   hook runs it non-interactively. New columns (`branches.error`, `created_by`, `steps.note`,
   `sessions.root_branch_id`) were added; nothing was dropped. The earlier upload-intent and
   alert-state tables are gone from the schema but harmless if they linger in an old database.
5. **Storage abstraction.** `storage.ts` keys blobs by relative path. Local disk under `DATA_DIR` by
   default; with `PRIVATE_OBJECT_DIR` (Replit App Storage) the same keys go to the bucket. Replit
   deployments have an ephemeral filesystem, so the bucket is what makes bundles durable there.
6. **Sandbox python is a venv under DATA_DIR** with pytest and flask, built on first boot from
   whatever `python3` is on PATH (Replit's `python-base-3.12` module). Its bin is prepended to the
   sandbox `PATH`; the host's python is never assumed to have anything installed.

## Trajectory model

7. **System prompt is not a step.** It lives on the branch; step 0 is the user task. Context at step
   k is `[system] + content of steps 0..k`.
8. **`tool_call` rows are not messages.** The assistant row carries the full message including
   `tool_calls`; each call also gets its own row for the scrubber. Rebuilding the message array skips
   `tool_call` rows. `/context` on a `tool_call` row returns the owning assistant step's context and
   says so with `requested_index` vs `step_index`.
9. **Forks copy the parent's steps** up to the boundary, so context and scrubber work the same on
   root and fork branches. `fork_step_index` is the effective boundary; the fork endpoint returns
   `requested_step_index`, `fork_step_index` and `snapped`, and the tree hangs forks off the effective
   step. Inherited steps carry zero token counts and keep their notes.
10. **Boundary snapping.** A fork at a `tool_call` row, or a `tool_result` whose turn still has
    unanswered calls, moves back to the end of the previous complete round.
11. **`MAX_MODEL_CALLS` counts model calls**, not rows. Inherited rows never count against a fork.
12. **Every mutating tool call commits**, even a no-op (`--allow-empty`); `run` commits only if it
    dirtied the tree. Seed repos ignore caches and run pytest with `-p no:cacheprovider`.
13. **Token count in `/context`** is the prompt size reported by the next model call when there is
    one, else a chars/4 estimate, and the response says which.

## Sandbox

14. **Whitelist, then `ulimit`, then exec.** Commands come from `.rewind.json`, are split without a
    shell, and run under `/bin/sh -c 'ulimit -f/-u/-v ...; exec "$0" "$@"'` with only `PATH`,
    `HOME`=worktree and `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE` in the environment. Timeouts kill the process
    group. `ulimit -v` is Linux only.
15. **Paths** are rejected on `..`, on resolving outside the worktree, on any symlink component
    including the leaf, and under `.git/`. Absolute paths are allowed only if inside the worktree.
16. **`read_file` on a directory lists it.** Without this a model that guesses a wrong filename has
    no way to recover and tends to loop. Still four tools.
17. **`unshare -n` / `-rn`** is tried on Linux and re-probed every ten minutes; most containers
    refuse it and the sandbox keeps the host network. The boot log says which mode you got.
18. **Loop detection.** The same tool with the same arguments three times in a row appends a warning
    to the result; a fourth time fails the branch. Output is not part of the signature (test timings
    vary). An edit between two test runs resets the streak.

## Operations

19. **Run leases.** A running branch renews `lease_expires_at` every few minutes; boot fails every
    non-terminal branch (workers died with the process) and a five-minute sweep fails any whose lease
    lapsed. Surviving worktrees are bundled first so steps stay viewable.
20. **Deletion queues bundles** in `bundle_cleanup_queue` and drains it with retries, so a storage
    hiccup never leaks a bundle. There is no branch-level delete: removing a mid-tree node would
    orphan its forks.
21. **Rate limits and the queue are in memory.** One process by design; a restart resets them.
22. **Daily token cap** sums tokens of branches created since UTC midnight and is checked before
    every create or fork. Running branches finish.
23. **Retries** are the OpenAI SDK's own: 408/409/429/5xx and connection errors with backoff, four
    attempts; 402 and other 4xx fail the branch immediately.
24. **Model ids** were verified against OpenRouter's public model list on 2026-09-09.

## Frontend

25. **Bundled Monaco**, no CDN. IBM Plex Sans and Mono from Google Fonts with system fallbacks.
26. **Scrubber semantics.** Tick height encodes kind, a dot marks a commit, an accent bar marks a
    note, inherited steps on a fork are dimmed and the fork point is a dashed line. Selecting the last
    step while live means "follow along".
27. **One SSE subscription per live branch** in the session so the whole tree moves. Terminal status
    closes the stream and refetches once.
28. **Compare view** lines up every fork of one parent and marks the first step whose signature
    (kind, tool, arguments; for results, committed and errored) differs. Output and timing are never
    part of the signature.
29. **Home cards** show a branch-length graph: one bar per branch, from its fork step, as long as its
    step count, coloured by status.
30. **Model text is rendered** with a 40-line inline renderer: paragraphs, lists, code, bold, fences.
31. **Frontend tests** cover the pure logic only (divergence, step clamping, cache merging, fork
    labels); components are exercised by hand in the browser.
32. **Visual theme is the Replit design's**: near-black navy, teal primary, amber accent, Space
    Grotesk for prose, IBM Plex Mono for data, square corners, small uppercase tracked labels, dotted
    ground. Kind colours: task sky, model violet, call amber, result teal. Only the skin changed; the
    components and behaviour are the port's.
33. **A remembered pane width is ignored** when it would leave the centre pane under 800px of room;
    the default split applies instead. Narrow windows never lose the scrubber.

## After the first Replit deploy

34. **Writes wait for the sandbox.** The venv builds after boot; until it is ready, session and fork
    requests return 503 "warming up" and the UI disables the buttons, instead of recording runs
    whose every test command fails.
35. **Sandbox pip uses the public index** with the host's pip config ignored: Replit's workspace pip
    points at an internal proxy the deployment VM cannot resolve. pip itself is bootstrapped from
    ensurepip or get-pip.py because Nix pythons ship without it.
36. **Identical failures end a loop one call earlier** than identical successes (3 vs 4): a failing
    command repeated verbatim has no chance of a different outcome.
37. **Per-session token budget** (300k) caps a runaway five-way fork without touching the daily cap.
38. **Read-only mode** (`REWIND_READ_ONLY=1`) is how the deployment stays public after the demo.
39. **Cost estimates** (`est_cost_usd`, from the model's list price) show on tree nodes, the top bar
    and the compare table. The compare table offers "Fork here" at the divergence step.
40. **Legacy bundle keys** from the first version (`/objects/rewind/bundles/...`) resolve to their
    old bucket path so those branches can still be opened and deleted.
41. **Three run modes, one code path.** `pnpm dev` runs API and Vite together (`scripts/dev.mjs`,
    no extra dependency); `pnpm build && pnpm start` serves everything from the API process; the
    Dockerfile does the same in a container; Replit runs the two artifacts through its path router.
    `.env` at the repo root is loaded by a module imported first in the API entrypoint, using
    Node's built-in loader, so local runs need no dotenv package and deployments need no `.env`.
42. **Root build skips the mockup sandbox.** It is Replit agent scaffolding with its own type
    errors and no part of the product; `pnpm build` typechecks and builds only the API and the UI.
43. **Hardening after review.** 500s return a generic message with the detail in the log; the boot
    migration runs under a Postgres advisory lock inside one transaction; `/api/ready` (and
    `/api/healthz`, the Replit health path) pings the database while `/api/health` stays a cheap
    liveness probe; the rate limit uses `req.ip` behind one trusted proxy hop instead of the first
    `X-Forwarded-For` entry. Declined from the same review: locking the parent on fork (steps are
    append-only, so nothing at or below the boundary can change) and durable cancellation (a restart
    fails every non-terminal branch, so there is nothing to cancel afterwards).
44. **Selection state resets per session.** The zustand store outlives the route, so diff and compare
    selections used to leak into the next session opened. Deep links validate the step as a
    non-negative integer. The delete control on home cards is a sibling of the link, not a child.

## Public demo

45. **Visitors can fork on the cheap model without a key** (`REWIND_PUBLIC_WRITES=cheap`, the
    default). The spec gates every write behind the key; for a public demo that hides the product's
    point, so keyless writes are allowed for the cheap model only, counted against the per-IP rate
    limit and a separate `PUBLIC_DAILY_TOKEN_CAP` (500k tokens, about five cents of DeepSeek). The
    key still unlocks other models, cancel, delete and notes. `off` restores the spec's behaviour.
46. **Home page explains itself** in three sentences and links "Start here" to the session with the
    most branches. A dismissable one-line hint sits under the scrubber on first visit.
47. **Monaco loads on demand.** The file viewer, diff view and compare view are lazy chunks, so the
    first paint of a session is the 100 KB app bundle, not the 1 MB editor.
48. **Relative `DATA_DIR` resolves against the repository root**, not the working directory:
    `pnpm dev` runs the API from `artifacts/api-server` and `pnpm start` from the root, and a data
    directory that moves between them made a finished parent's bundle vanish. A missing parent
    bundle now fails the fork with a clear message instead of silently cloning the base repo.
49. **Seed session titles are for humans**: "Five identical forks of one bug fix", "Same task, three
    models", "Add a feature to a small Flask app".

## Railway showcase

50. **The Railway deployment is a read-only showcase.** `REWIND_READ_ONLY=1` and
    `REWIND_PUBLIC_WRITES=off` on the service: no sessions, forks, cancels, deletes or notes; the UI
    hides those controls and says the runs are recorded. Five curated sessions, fourteen branches,
    recorded with DeepSeek V4 Flash roots and GPT-5.4 Mini and Gemini 3.8 Flash comparison forks,
    live in its Postgres and volume. The Replit deployment of the same code stays interactive.
51. **Phones show one pane at a time.** Below the md breakpoint the session page keeps the scrubber
    on top and switches the body between Steps, Files and Branches with a bar at the bottom; diff and
    compare modes jump to Steps. Stacking all three panes gave each a sliver of a 780px screen. The
    top bar drops the subtitle and token readout on small screens and the home search fills the bar.
52. **Egress.** Responses are gzipped in-process (except SSE) because the platform meters bytes
    leaving the container, not what its edge later compresses; hashed assets under `/assets` are
    `immutable, max-age=1y` and `index.html` is `no-cache`; Monaco is built from the core editor plus
    the ten languages the seed repos use instead of the full package, 4.0 MB down to 2.7 MB raw.
    A first visit that opens a file costs about 0.8 MB of egress instead of 4.3 MB; a return visit
    costs a few kilobytes of API JSON.
